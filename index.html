		<p>Hi! My name is Ashley Brooks and I am a student at the University of Denver.  Currently I am pursuing a certificate program in Web Development.  It has been 3 weeks so far and I applaud anyone who has mastered the skill of coding!  It is fun but it is also quite challenging. Just to tell you a little more about me personally, I enjoy traveling, hiking, reading books, playing pinball, skating, and dancing. I would love to have a career with the option to work remotely.  I would travel every month to somewhere new and do my work in dream destinations! There is too much to see in this world and I don't want to stay in one place for too long!</p>
